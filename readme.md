Provided are 2 different solutions to Euler problem 7.

The first is more of a brute force implementation and the second is using a sieve implementation.  

The sieve needs a bit more work finding the potential max numbers of primes to calculate, but since it was significantly slower than the brute force for the specific problem, it wasn't worth the effort.
